You are editing an existing SVG-based dragon mascot. The mascot is already created as SVG layers/paths, and you must update, improve, and fix all animations generated from these SVG elements.
All animations must preserve full body integrity: arms, legs, wings, tail, head, hands, eyes, and every body part must always remain physically connected to the body. No floating parts, no detached limbs, no misaligned shapes, no sliding or drifting SVG paths. The dragon must move as a single, cohesive, anatomically consistent character.

SVG Structure Requirements

Maintain correct grouping of limbs (each arm, leg, wing, head, tail must stay in its proper <g> group).

No path should move independently in a way that breaks anatomy.

Movements must follow natural pivot points (shoulder, hip, neck, wing joints, tail base).

No distortion of shapes unless intentionally squashed/stretch in a connected way.

Correctly anchor each SVG part so it rotates/moves from the right joint.

Smooth, consistent, cohesive animation transitions.

Clean up any existing SVG irregularities, misaligned paths, or ungrouped elements.

Fix All Existing Animations

Repair and refine all the currently generated animations so they:

Do NOT break body structure

Do NOT cause limbs to separate

Do NOT cause eyes/mouth to float

Do NOT deform incorrectly

Do NOT shift/slide independently

Move like a real character with natural joints

Maintain full-body connection at all times

Create/Improve Animations (SVG-Safe, Joint-Accurate, Fully Connected)

All of the following must be updated or newly generated while keeping body integrity:

Basic Body Actions

Waving (arm rotates from shoulder joint only)

Jumping (legs bend, wings + tail follow motion)

Walking

Running

Sitting

Sleeping

Stretching

Turning left/right

Breathing idle (chest + body slightly scaling together)

Tail sway (tail stays attached fully from the base)

Wing Animations

Wing flapping (rotate from the wing joint)

Small idle wing shakes

Folding/unfolding wings

Facial Expressions

Blinking

Smiling

Surprise

Sad

Angry

Laughing

Blushing
(All facial elements remain aligned within the head group)

Interactive Animations

Reaction to clicks

Reaction to cursor hover

Running toward cursor

Jumping on click

Looking around idle animation

Overall Animation Quality Rules

No broken rigging

No floating SVG paths

No clipping between layers

Natural timing, easing, and joint rotation

Tail and wings follow body physics smoothly

Keep the original style of the dragon mascot

Make animations smooth, cute, expressive, and polished
